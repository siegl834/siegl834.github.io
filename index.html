	<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<p>
In this assignment I was tasked with buliding code from scratch. I needed to make a home page for my
DPR 241 class portolio. The page you are looking at now is one in the same, the page also needed to have media queries. 
People needed to be able to see my page on different devices. There is a list of other requirements such as the file 
name had to be index.html. The stylesheet needs at least two divs and classes, two or more columns that collapses into one once 
the screen gets smaller. There are a few more requirements but i'm not going to list them all.
</p>
<p>
Overall the assigment was really cool, I have never coded media queries before. My classes before had never asked 
for them. I had truble understaning how every thing was supposed fit and change to the different screen sizes.
I would think that one of the big benefits to having them in your code is, it allows people to view you pages on 
different devices not just a web page. But on the other hand from what I read a weaknesses is not all media queries 
can run on all platforms.

	<h2>Resume Using Skeleton</h2>
<p>
This is my third assignment and I had to code my 2020 resume into a web page. There where no real rules to follow on how 
this page needed to look, I was allowed to the freedom to design the page style. The only requirement was to 
use a Skeleton Grid System for the base formatting. As long as I added in the code right the page would handle 
being responsive on its own. 
</p>
<p>
From what I gathered using Grid Systems is a cleaner way to laying out a webpage. I dont know much about the complex 
inner working of this system but form my first hand with this type of code I found it to be easy to use. 
It deffintly toke me some time to understand it because I didn't really get the whole row and columns 
at first, It was a bit confusing rembering the opening and closing points because of how many there are in just one row. 
I know I had to go back many times and rewrite the code because I just coulnd't see where I missed a closing point. 
I think a weaknesses is that the format is centerd all in the middle, it may just be that I dont know this code 
very well but if it is indeed only displaying your code in the middle then your pages could start to look boring. 
For me I definitely found this to be easier then the Media Queeries, I didnt have to do much in terms of chaning 
for the different screen sizes. The Skeleton did all that work for me all I had to do was change some of the text 
sizes or placement. I real liked this over the Media Queeries.
